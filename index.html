				<u><b>3/22/2016::RPG Character Creator</b></u><br>
				Over the last week or so I have been working on a new project that I have not named yet
			but the goal of the application is to allow players of games like Dungeon's and Dragons or Pathfinder
			and easy way to manage all of there user created content on there home PC or as a long term goal I 
			would like to port the program to the web that way you can access your characters any where at anytime.
			To see what progress I have made so far you can look at the gihub repo and look at my code <a href = "https://github.com/DylanGuidry95/RestructureCode" target ="_blank">
			here.</a> If you have any questions or have input about some features you would like to see in the final 
			version of the product send me an email and I will try to get back to you as soon as I can.

				<u><b>3/17/2016::Serialization Tutorial</b></u><br>
				Today and yesterday I was instructed by my Instructor to do some research serilization in C# to 
			Persist data into some file type to be used again at some later time. During my research I was able to
			implement the material and felt commfortable enough with my newly gained knowledge that my Instructor 
			asked me to write a through tutorial on how Persist objects using serilization in C# using BinaryFormatter
			and SoapFormatter and present the material to both my class and the first year programming students at 
			my school. You can find all of my source for the example project <a href = "https://github.com/DylanGuidry95/SerializationTut" target="_blank">
			here.</a> In the readme you can find links to the google docs and you can leave comments if you have questions
			on the material. I will try to post the material formally on my webpage as soon as possible.

		<h2>About Me</h2>
		<div class="ImageDescriptions" style="border-radius:1em; width:475px">
			<p><b>
					I am currently attending the Academy of Interactive Entertainment enrolled in the Game 
				Programming curriculum. I am scheduled to graduate in June of 2016 with an Advanced 
				Diploma of Professional Game Development. I am always looking for new and exciting ways to 
				better myself as a software developer and deliver the best product I can possibly produce. I 
				have always had a passion for gaming in general but it wasnâ€™t till I took a Computer Science 
				class my sophomore year of high school and got to explore the possibilities of programming with 
				Visual Basic ,and that's when I knew I wanted to make a career as a software developer, 
				with an intrest in game development. <br>
