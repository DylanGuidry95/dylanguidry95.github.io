<h3>About Me</h3>
	<p>
			I am currently attending the Academy of Interactive Entertainment enrolled in the Game <br>
		Programming curriculum. I am scheduled to graduate in June of 2016 with an Advanced <br>
		Diploma of Professional Game Development. I am always looking for new and exciting ways to <br> 
		better myself as a software developer and deliver the best product I can possibly produce. I <br>
		have always had a passion for gaming in general but it wasnâ€™t till I took a Computer Science <br>
		class my sophomore year of high school and got to explore the possibilities of programming with <br>
		Visual Basic ,and that's when I knew I wanted to make a career as a software developer, <br>
		with an intrest in game development. <br>

<h3>Developing an Application</h3>
	<p>
		<font size = "10px"><u><i>BOIDS Algorithm</u></i></font><br>
		The applicaton where I implemented the BOIDS Algorithm using the Unity Engine to show off my work <br>
		was the first assessment I had to start of my second year at AIE. It was the no easy tasks. It was my <br>
		first time seeing and trying to solve any of the three rules of BOIDS. Once I had worked alot of sample <br>
		problems on my own and with my class, the equations where becoming more and more clear the more I practiced. <br>
		<br>
		When I had finally began to implement the algorithm in Unity using c# there were a few issues I had encountered. <br>
		Some of these problems where the boids behaving correctly at spawn but as soon as a value was changed it would <br>
		break. I found out after testing multiple cases that my coeficients to modify the values where being calculated <br>
		out of order.<br>
		<br>
		The biggest problem I had encountered was with GitHub. When versioning I had forgot to push some important files up <br>
		to the website. Then when I got home and began working I had some conflicts with the repository and had to redo a some <br>
		key parts of the applicaton. <br>
		<br>
