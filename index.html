<h3>About Me</h3>
	<p>
			I am currently attending the Academy of Interactive Entertainment enrolled in the Game <br>
		Programming curriculum. I am scheduled to graduate in June of 2016 with an Advanced <br>
		Diploma of Professional Game Development. I am always looking for new and exciting ways to <br> 
		better myself as a software developer and deliver the best product I can possibly produce. I <br>
		have always had a passion for gaming in general but it wasnâ€™t till I took a Computer Science <br>
		class my sophomore year of high school and got to explore the possibilities of programming with <br>
		Visual Basic ,and that's when I knew I wanted to make a career as a software developer, <br>
		with an intrest in game development. <br>
