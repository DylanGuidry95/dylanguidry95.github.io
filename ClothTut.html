	<h3> What is Involved in a Cloth Simulation? </h3>
	<p>
		<pre>
	The three parts a Cloth Simulation is comprised of are as follows 
		- Nodes 
		- Spring Damper 
		- Aerodynamics 
	Each of these three parts are broken down in to smaller parts that will make them what
	they are and define how they will behave in our simulation. Another key part that you 
	will need to know about creating a working Cloth Simulation is what are the steps. 
		1) Compute Forces 
			- For each node: Apply gravity 
			- For each spring damper: Compute and apply forces 
			- For each triangel(used for aerodynamics): Compute and apply forces 
		2) Intergrate Motion 
			- For each node: Apply forward Euler Intergration 
		3) Repeat 
		</pre>
	</p>
	<h3> What is a Node </h3>
	<p>
		<pre>
	Each Node in the system has its own properties assigned to it that we will need to calcualte for
	in order for our cloth to behave properly.
	Parts of a Node
		- mass
		- velocity
		- acceleration
		- Force
	Now that we know what makes up a node we can begin to set up a base class for our Particals.
